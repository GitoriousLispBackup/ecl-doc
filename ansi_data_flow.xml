  <title>Minimal compilation</title>

  <para>Former versions of &ECL;, as well as many other lisps, used linked
  lists to represent code. Executing code thus meant traversing these lists
  and performing code transformations, such as macro expansion, every time
  that a statement was to be executed. The result was a slow and memory
  hungry interpreter.</para>

  <para>Beginning with version 0.3, &ECL; was shipped with a bytecodes
  compiler and interpreter which circumvent the limitations of linked
  lists. When you enter code at the lisp prompt, or when you load a source
  file, &ECL; begins a process known as minimal compilation. Barely this
  process consists on parsing each form, macroexpanding it and translating it
  into an intermediate language made of
  <emphasis>bytecodes</emphasis>.</para>

  <para>The bytecodes compiler is implemented in
  <filename>src/c/compiler.d</filename>. The main entry point is the lisp
  function <function>si::make-lambda</function>, which takes a name for the
  function and the body of the lambda lists, and produces a lisp object that
  can be invoked. For instance,
  <screen>&gt; (defvar fun (si::make-lambda 'f '((x) (1+ x))))
*FUN*
&gt; (funcall fun 2)
3</screen></para>

  <para>&ECL; can only execute bytecodes. When a list is passed to
  <literal>EVAL</literal> it must be first compiled to bytecodes and, if the
  process succeeds, the resulting bytecodes are passed to the
  interpreter. Similarly, every time a function object is created, such as in
  <function>DEFUN</function> or <function>DEFMACRO</function>, the compiler
  processes the lambda form to produce a suitable bytecodes object.</para>

  <para>The fact that &ECL; performs this eager compilation means that
  changes on a macro are not immediately seen in code which was already
  compiled. This has subtle implications. Take the following code:</para>
  <screen>&gt; (defmacro f (a b) `(+ ,a ,b))
F
&gt; (defun g (x y) (f x y))
G
&gt; (g 1 2)
3
&gt; (defmacro f (a b) `(- ,a ,b))
F
&gt; (g 1 2)
3</screen>

  <para>The last statement always outputs <literal>3</literal> while in former
  implementations based on simple list traversal it would produce
  <literal>-1</literal>.</para>

 <section xml:id="ansi.functions">
  <title>Functions</title>

  <para>Functions in &ECL; can be of two types: they are either compiled to
  bytecodes or they have been compiled to machine code using a lisp to C
  translator and a C compiler. To the first category belong function loaded
  from lisp source files or entered at the toplevel. To the second category
  belong all functions in the &ECL; core environment and functions in files
  processed by <function>compile</function> or
  <function>compile-file</function>.</para>

  <para>The output of <code>(symbol-function
  <replaceable>fun</replaceable>)</code> is a list, is either a function
  object if <literal>'fun</literal> is has a function definition,
  <literal>(macro . function-object)</literal> if <literal>'fun</literal> is
  a macro, and <literal>'special</literal> if <literal>'fun</literal> is a
  special form.</para>

  <para>&ECL; usually drops the source code of a function unless the global
  variable <varname>si:*keep-definitions*</varname> was true when the
  function was translated into bytecodes. Therefore, if you wish to use
  <function>compile</function> and <function>disassemble</function> on
  defined functions, you should issue <code>(setq si:*keep-definitions*
  t)</code> at the beginning of your session.</para>

  <para>In <xref linkend="table.function.constants"/> we list all
  &CommonLisp; values related to the limits of functions.</para>

 <section xml:id="ansi.calling-conventions">
   <title>C Calling conventions</title>

   <para>&ECL; is implemented using either a C or a C++ compiler. This is not a limiting factor, but imposes some constraints on how these languages are used to implement functions, multiple values, closures, etc. The first important constraint is that, while C functions can be called with a variable number of arguments, there is no facility to check how many values were actually passed. This forces us to have two types of functions in &ECL;
   <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>Functions that take a fixed number of arguments have a simple C signature, with all arguments being properly declared, as in <code>cl_object cl_not(cl_object arg1)</code>.</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>Functions with a variable number of arguments, such as those acception <symbol>&optional;</symbol>, <symbol>&rest;</symbol> or <symbol>&key;</symbol> arguments, must take as first argument the number of remaining ones, as in <code>cl_object cl_list(cl_narg narg, ...)</code>. Here <replaceable>narg</replaceable> is the number of supplied arguments.</para></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   The previous conventions set some burden on the C programmer that calls &ECL;, for she must know the type of function that is being called and supply the right number of arguments. This burden disappears for Common Lisp programmers, though.</para>

   <para>The second limitation of C and C++ is that functions can only take a limited number of arguments. In order to cope with this problem, &ECL; uses an internal stack to pass any argument above a hardcoded limit, <constant>ECL_C_CALL_ARGUMENTS_LIMIT</constant>, which is as of this writing 63. The use of this stack is transparently handled by the Common Lisp functions, such as <symbol>apply</symbol>, <symbol>funcall</symbol> and their C equivalents, and also by a set of macros, <link linkend="ref.cl_va_arg"><function>cl_va_arg</function></link>, which can be used for coding functions that take an arbitrary name of arguments.</para>
